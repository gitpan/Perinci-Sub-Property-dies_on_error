    Without dies_on_error:

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]

     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # [404, "Not found"]

    With "dies_on_error => 1":

     # on successful call
     f(...); # [200, "OK"]

     # on non-successful call
     f(...); # dies with message "Call f() failed with 404 status: Not found"

    success_statuses => '^2..$' }".
